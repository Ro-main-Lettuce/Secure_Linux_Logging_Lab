# VM Networking Failure: Troubleshooting and Resolution Summary

## What Happened

A minimal Ubuntu server VM stopped obtaining an IP address. As a result:

- SSH failed (no IP, no route).
- Internet connectivity was lost.
- DHCP client failed silently.
- DNS resolution broke (`resolv.conf` was misconfigured or empty).
- The VM was not connected to an active virtual bridge on the host.

The server was using `systemd-networkd`, not `Netplan` or `NetworkManager`, so traditional tools and configs were unavailable.

## Symptoms

- `ip a` showed `enp1s0` was up but had no IP address.
- `journalctl -u systemd-networkd` showed repeated DHCP lease lost/timeouts.
- SSH gave `No route to host` errors.
- DNS resolution did not work even after networking was partially restored.

## Host-Level Issues

- The host had multiple libvirt networks (`default`, `nat0`, `yellowsubmarine`), and the VMâ€™s NIC was attached to an inactive or misconfigured one.
- Firewall rules and a VPN interfered with DNS and DHCP.
- The libvirt `default` network was inactive.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Network Validation

```bash
ip a
journalctl -u systemd-networkd

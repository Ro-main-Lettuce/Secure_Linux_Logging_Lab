I set up a virtual machine environment to deepen my understanding of virtualization, networking, network security, logging, and automation. 
Initially, I encountered issues using VirtualBox, including kernel driver errors and conflicts with KVM extensions. Due to these problems, I switched to using KVM as the hypervisor, which required removing the VirtualBox setup.


After successfully installing and configuring a Linux server VM with Ubuntu, I configured networking using NAT to allow internet access.
I chose to use the entire disk for storage during installation without enabling encryption to simplify the setup. I installed the OpenSSH server on the VM to enable secure remote access.

For remote management, I set up SSH key-based authentication. This involved generating SSH key pairs on my local Fedora machine, copying the public key to the server, and verifying passwordless login to enhance security and convenience.

I also explored configuring the firewall on the server using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall). I enabled it, set basic rules to allow SSH traffic, 
and checked the firewall status to ensure proper protection.

Overall, this project involved troubleshooting virtualization environment issues, setting up and securing a Linux server VM,
and configuring remote access and firewall rules. For more detailed information, I recommend consulting official KVM and UFW documentation, as well as tutorials on SSH key management.

Next steps include automating server configuration with tools like Ansible, setting up logging and monitoring, and exploring advanced network security measures within the VM environment.
